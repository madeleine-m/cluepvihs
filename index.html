            <p><em>(The curtains are closed on a warmly lit stage. WADSWORTH walks out on stage carrying a small table and a CLUE board game. He sets it up the game on the table, taking out the YELLOW piece and setting it down)</em></p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD enters in front of the stage. She whistles with one hand in her pocket, the other holding a letter she is looking over.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK]</p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD stops in her tracks. She turns her head slightly as if to not let the dogs know she sees them.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WHITE steps in the direction of the “dog” that will be in the direction of the audience. She feels her foot step in something. Annoyed, she takes off her shoe and holds it up. She sniffs the air before aggressively sniffing the shoe. Taken aback, she gags as she is overwhelmed by the smell. Disgustedly, she puts her shoe back on and hurries off with a pained look on her face)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH holds up the BLUE piece and sets it down.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(PEACOCK enters holding her coat wrapped around her tightly.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #6]</p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Nervously to the dog) </em>Thanks.</p>

            <p><em>(Finally, WADSWORTH presents both PURPLE and RED game pieces. He sets them down on the board)</em></p>

            <p><em>(Angrily, SCARLET enters in a huff)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Damn car...piece of junk.</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #7]</p>

            <p>SCARLET. Shut up!</p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh come on...</p>

            <p><em>(PLUM enters slyly from the same direction)</em></p>

            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I noticed a car pulled over on the roadside there. Need a lift?</p>

            <p><em>(SCARLET brushes herself off and fixes her hair, attempting to make herself look more attractive)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yes please. I’m late for a dinner date.</p>

            <p><strong>PLUM. </strong>Where to?</p>

            <p><em>(Both exit back the way they came from.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH smiles and stands up straight. He turns to face the curtains with his hands behind his back.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH. </strong><em>(Calling off to stage L wing.) </em> Curtains, please.</p>

            <p><em>(He follows the curtain off stage. YVETTE comes to pick up the table with the CLUE board and puts it aside.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH moves behind YVETTE.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>NEWSCASTER</strong>. (Beneath the following dialogue until cut off:) “Time and time again, without apology or evasion, I—and many members of this administration—have stood for the right of the individual, for free expression of convictions, even though those convictions might be unpopular, and for uncensored use of our libraries, except as dictated by common decency.”</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Rather intimately:) Yvette?</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE yelps, startled!)</em></p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Monsieur! I didn’t hear you come in! You frightened me half to death!</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Wouldn’t want to do that. There are so many better ways to die.</p>

            <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Please turn off that noise.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE turns off the TV—cutting off the news.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Is everything ready?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good. (Calling off:) Cook?</p>

            <p><em>(In a flash of thunder/lightning, a formidable COOK, dressed perfectly, appears from the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. You called, sir?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Everything on schedule?</p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. Dinner will be ready at 7:30.</p>

            <p><strong>[MUSIC CUE #2]</strong></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. (Revealing a butcher knife on a music sting:) Sharp.</p>

            <p><em>(Just then, the doorbell rings. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Ah. Right on time. You have your instructions?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Very well then.</p>

            <p><em>(He moves to the door. YVETTE pushes off the TV. COOK exits to the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Just before opening the door:) Let the game begin.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good evening.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Yes, indeed you are expected, Colonel.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. How do you—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Interrupting:) It is Colonel Mustard, isn’t it?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. No, that’s not my name. My name is Colonel—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I believe it’s been recommended that tonight you use a pseudonym.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh, no thank you. I took an antihistamine before I came.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Taking his coat:) May I take your coat?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh. All right. I suppose I . . .</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE, at the bar cart, now pops open a bottle of champagne, a la a gunshot, startling MUSTARD who yelps.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Not to worry, Colonel. It’s just the maid, in the Hall, with the champagne cork.</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Offering:) Champagne?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Taking the glass, flummoxed by her beauty:) Oh, uh, don’t mind if I . . .</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Interrupting:) Zis way Monsieur.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Following her anywhere:) Ah. Thank you.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE escorts MUSTARD to the door of the Lounge. The doorbell interrupts. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Are you expecting someone else?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Indeed. I’ll be with you in a moment.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Do come in, madam. You are expected.</p>

            <p><em>(She enters more fully, WADSWORTH at her heels.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Welcome.</p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. (With a confident mystique:) Do you know who I am?</p>

            <p><em>(She pulls back her veil, to reveal her face.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Only that you are a socialite to be known this evening as Mrs. White.</p>

            <p><em>(She slips off her cloak, black with a brilliantly white inside.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. Yes.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I’ll be right with you.</p>

            <p><em>(The module of the set containing the door to the Lounge, now pulls open slightly, making the interior of the Lounge partially visible as WHITE steps through the door, noticing MUSTARD.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> You think I can’t handle a little blackmail?!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> (Taking the reins:) Who is this Boddy fella, you brutish butler?!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Who Ms. Boddy is, is no concern of yours. Suffice it to say, he’s a supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee—and he feels your activities have been decidedly un-American.</p>
            <p><em>(They ALL begin to protest . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> My task this evening is to expose your secrets to each other—rendering you all culpable in each others’ indiscretions.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But we hardly know each other.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Precisely.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Don’t you think that you might spare us this humiliation?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I’m afraid I have no choice. We’ll start with you, Professor Plum.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Perching on the desk:)</em> Oooh, this oughta be good.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> It says here you were once a professor of psychiatry, specializing in pathological, lying lunatics suffering from delusions of grandeur.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Yes, but now I work for the U.S. government.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> So, your work has not changed.</p>
            <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But you can’t practice medicine anymore, can you? Your license has been lifted, correct?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Why? What’d he do?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You know what male doctors aren’t supposed to do with their lady patients?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yeah?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yeah, well, he did.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> How awful! You know, someday there will be a reckoning for men like you!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> I hope so.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(A la the hashtag:)</em> Me too.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Harshly whispered:)</em> You’re disgusting.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Are you making moral judgements, Mrs. Peacock?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Well, I —</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> How then, do you justify taking bribes in return for delivering Senator Peacock’s votes to certain lobbyists?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Defensive:)</em> My husband is a paid consultant. There’s nothing sinful about that!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Not if it’s publicly declared. But if you slip cash under the stall door at Old Ebbitt’s Grill? How would you describe that transaction?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I’d say it stinks.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Accusatorially:)</em> When were you in that men’s room?</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> So, it’s true!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> No, it’s a vicious lie!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But you’ve been paying blackmail for over a year now to keep that story out of the papers. Seems a little . . . sticky, no?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Now see here—</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> Well, I’m willing to believe you. I too am being blackmailed for something I didn’t do.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN/MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Piping up at the same moment:)</em> So am I.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Not me.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You’re not being blackmailed?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh, I’m being blackmailed, all right. But I did what I’m being blackmailed for.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> What did you do?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I run my own business.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> That’s not a crime.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> You didn’t ask what kind of a business I run.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> All right, what kind of business do you run?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I provide gentlemen with the company of a young lady.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Outraged:)</em> An escort service?! In Washington?!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> How scurrilous.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> I’m sure some people are just a little lonely.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(Scoffing:)</em> A man who needs to pay to spend time with a woman. That’s a problem I’ll never have.</p>
            <p><em>(He slyly takes a business card SCARLET has pulled from her cleavage and tucks it in his coat pocket.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Is that how you knew Colonel Mustard works in Washington? Is he one of your clients?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Certainly not!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I was asking Miss Scarlet.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(To SCARLET:)</em> Well, you tell him it’s not true!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> “It’s not true.”</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Is that true?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> No, it’s not true.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Ha-hah! So it is true!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> A double negative!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Double “negative”? You mean you have—photographs?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> That sounds like a confession to me. In fact, the double negative has led to proof positive. I’m afraid you gave yourself away.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Are you trying to make me look stupid in front of the other guests?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You don’t need any help from me, sir.</p>
            <p><em>(MUSTARD starts to register the insult—but . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Colonel, looks like you hold a sensitive security post in the Pentagon. Those “negatives” would most certainly compromise your position.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(With a wink:)</em> And what position exactly were you caught in, Colonel?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> This is an outrage!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Changing focus:)</em> Let’s see, who’s next?</p>
            <p><em>(He charges towards GREEN but spins on a dime at the last moment to . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Mrs. White, you’ve been paying our friend the blackmailer ever since your husband died under, shall we say, mysterious circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Say what you want. I didn’t kill him.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Then why are you paying the blackmailer?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> I don’t want another scandal, do I?</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Another?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> We had a very humiliating confrontation. He had threatened to kill me in public.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Why would he want to kill you in public?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I think she meant that he had threatened, in public, to kill her.</p>
            <p><em>(They all react with understanding.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> It was all over the papers.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> And yet he was the one who died. Not you, Mrs. White, not you.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> He was found dead at home. Unclothed. His head had been cut off and so had his . . . you know.</p>
            <p><em>(She gestures in the direction of her groin. They all react.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> But, I didn’t do it. I’d been out all evening, at the movies.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> What was showing?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> The Naked Alibi.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> A likely story.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But he was your second husband. Your first also disappeared.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> That was his job—he was an illusionist.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But he never reappeared.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> He wasn’t a very good illusionist.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Now to GREEN:)</em> And lastly, Mr. Green, who is a . . .</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I don’t need you to unmask me, Wadsworth. I know what you’re gonna say about me!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> What’s that?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> “Mr. Green, who is a homosexual.”</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Not me.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> You asked, “Who is a homosexual,” and I said, not me.</p>
            <p><em>(GREEN and WADSWORTH share a baffled moment.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yes, thank you, Colonel.</p>
            <p><em>(To GREEN:)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But, there’s more to it than that, Mr. Green.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> How do you mean?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> There’s evidence to support the question of . . . your politics.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> My politics?! Since when is working for the Republican party a crime?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You swore an oath of allegiance to the Republican party, but neglected to vote for Eisenhower in the last election. That’s grounds for an ousting if ever there was one.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> But voting records are confidential!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Everything has its price, Mr. Green.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> So—there you have it.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Bordering hysteria:)</em> Have what?!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> A crooked Senator’s wife, a lascivious doctor, a disloyal Republican, and so forth . . . not exactly adhering to an all-American standard of behavior, are you?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Knowingly:)</em> Depends on who you ask.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But if this Boddy fella is such a noble civilian himself, than why didn’t he report us to the authorities?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> And give up the opportunity to make a buck? Come now, Professor. What could be more American than that?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(In earnest:)</em> Apple pie.</p>
            <p><em>(A collective eye roll.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> All right, Wadsworth—so we’re being blackmailed by a renegade McCarthyist. Where does that leave us?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Where is this Ms. Boddy?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> And what does she want from us?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Who cares?! I’m not waiting to find out! I’ve done nothing wrong! I’m leaving!</p>
            <p><em>(She charges to the door.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Blocking her efforts:)</em> I’m sorry, Mrs. Peacock. You can stay in denial, but you cannot leave this house!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> I am the wife of a great Senator! You can’t tell me what to do!</p>
            <p><em>(She tries to open the door.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>BODDY.</strong> Bribing all these good people?</p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> And why would we agree to that?</p>
            <p><strong>BODDY.</strong> Because if you don’t, I’ll put this briefcase—containing all the evidence needed to expose your wrongdoings—in the hands of the police, the press, and the House Un-American Committee.
