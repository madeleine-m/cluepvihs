Annoyed, she takes off her shoe and holds it up. She sniffs the air before aggressively sniffing the shoe. Taken aback, she gags as she is overwhelmed by the smell. Disgustedly, she puts her shoe back on and hurries off with a pained look on her face)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Where is this darn address...</p>

                    <p>[CUE DOG BARK #6]</p>

                    <p><em>(Startled, GREEN points in the direction he came from and then holds up his hand to thank the dog. He hurries off back the way he came from, terrified)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I noticed a car pulled over on the roadside there. Need a lift?</p>

                    <p><em>(SCARLET brushes herself off and fixes her hair, attempting to make herself look more attractive)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>PLUM. </strong>Where to?</p>

                    <p><em>(Both exit back the way they came from.)</em></p>

                    <p><em>(WADSWORTH smiles and stands up straight. He turns to face the curtains with his hands behind his back.)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Rather intimately:) Yvette?</p>

                    <p><em>(YVETTE yelps, startled!)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Wouldn’t want to do that. There are so many better ways to die.</p>

                    <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Please turn off that noise.</p>

                    <p><em>(YVETTE turns off the TV—cutting off the news.)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Is everything ready?</p>

                    <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good. (Calling off:) Cook?</p>

                    <p><em>(In a flash of thunder/lightning, a formidable COOK, dressed perfectly, appears from the Kitchen.)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>COOK</strong>. You called, sir?</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Everything on schedule?</p>

                    <p><strong>COOK</strong>. Dinner will be ready at 7:30.</p>

                    <p><em>(He moves to the door. YVETTE pushes off the TV. COOK exits to the Kitchen.)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Another?</p>
                    <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> We had a very humiliating confrontation. He had threatened to kill me in public.</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I think she meant that he had threatened, in public, to kill her.</p>

                    <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> But, I didn’t do it. I’d been out all evening, at the movies.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> What was showing?</p>
                    <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> The Naked Alibi.</p>

                    <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> It’s coming from the Library.</p>
                    <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> That’s where the killer must be!</p>

                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>Then Ms. Boddy arrived and we all went to the Study.</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Ms. Boddy was dead. But not really. Really he was alive. But we didn’t know it. Then, Mrs. Peacock drank his drink . . .</p>
                    <p><em>(He drinks from Peacock’s flask and spits all over the GUESTS.)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>(As Peacock:) </strong>Poison!</p>
                    <p><strong>(He screams, PEACOCK screams, he screams. He slaps himself.)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(As Scarlet:) </strong>Well, someone had to stop her screaming!</p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>And then we heard . . .</p>
                    <p><em>(He lip syncs to a sound cue of Yvette screaming.)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>To the Billiard Room! But Mrs. Peacock joined late.</p>
                    <p><strong>(As Peacock:) </strong>I’m an old woman who may or may not have been poisoned.</p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>Then Mrs. White asked . . .</p>

                    <p><em>(He mimes stabbing her, then imitates the Cook falling dead out of the freezer onto Green.)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(As Green:) </em>Oh God. Oh God. So gross. Blood. Germs. <em>(Muffled by his own arm:) </em>Will somebody help me up!</p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself, miming dragging the Cook:) </strong>I suggested we take the Cook’s body into the Study.</p>
                    <p><strong>(He lies as “dead” Boddy, then hops up, revealing a blank space!)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>But Boddy’s body was gone!</p>
                    <p><em>(He mimes draping himself over an imaginary Peacock.)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>Then Mrs. Peacock entered with Boddy on her body because Boddy had been bludgeoned in his bean.</p>
                    <p><strong>(Then:) </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(As himself:) </strong>Then, the briefcase!</p>
                    <p><em>(He mimes opening the briefcase at the desk. They gasp.)</em></p>

Kill off my entire network of spies and informers - which you all did, splendidly, by the way. Generously leaving your fingerprints on every glass, doorknob, and... dead body.

                    <p><strong>ALL</strong>. Game?!</p>
                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Well, yeah, I'm relaxed now, you see. Now that you've killed everyone off - there's no evidence left against me. I've got off... scot-free.</p>
                    <p><strong>PLUM</strong>. But the police will be here any minute. You'll never get away with this!</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Now, listen up, you reprobates. We're gonna stack the bodies in the cellar, lock the cellar door, leave Boddy Manor one at a time, and forget that any of this ever happened.</p>
                    <p><strong>PLUM</strong>. I can't forget all this!</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Now move!</p>

                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Oh, come on, you don't think I'm gonna fall for that old trick.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCARLET</strong>. It's not a trick.</p>

                    <p><strong>SCARLET</strong>. One plus two plus two plus one.</p>
                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Uh-uh. There was only one shot that got the chandelier, that's one plus two plus ONE plus one.</p>
                    <p><strong>SCARLET</strong>. Even if you were right, that would be one plus one plus two plus one, not one plus two plus one plus one.</p>
                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Okay fine. One plus two plus-SHUT UP! Point is, there is one bullet left in this gun, and anybody who moves is gonna get it!</p>
                    <p><strong>GREEN</strong>. So, you're just gonna keep blackmailing us and we're all supposed to pretend this never happened?</p>
                    <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Of course. Why not?</p>
