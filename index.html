            <p><em>(The curtains are closed on a warmly lit stage. WADSWORTH walks out on stage carrying a small table and a CLUE board game. He sets it up the game on the table, taking out the YELLOW piece and setting it down)</em></p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD enters in front of the stage. She whistles with one hand in her pocket, the other holding a letter she is looking over.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK]</p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD stops in her tracks. She turns her head slightly as if to not let the dogs know she sees them.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WHITE steps in the direction of the “dog” that will be in the direction of the audience. She feels her foot step in something. Annoyed, she takes off her shoe and holds it up. She sniffs the air before aggressively sniffing the shoe. Taken aback, she gags as she is overwhelmed by the smell. Disgustedly, she puts her shoe back on and hurries off with a pained look on her face)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH holds up the BLUE piece and sets it down.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(PEACOCK enters holding her coat wrapped around her tightly.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #6]</p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Nervously to the dog) </em>Thanks.</p>

            <p><em>(Finally, WADSWORTH presents both PURPLE and RED game pieces. He sets them down on the board)</em></p>

            <p><em>(Angrily, SCARLET enters in a huff)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Damn car...piece of junk.</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #7]</p>

            <p>SCARLET. Shut up!</p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh come on...</p>

            <p><em>(PLUM enters slyly from the same direction)</em></p>

            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I noticed a car pulled over on the roadside there. Need a lift?</p>

            <p><em>(SCARLET brushes herself off and fixes her hair, attempting to make herself look more attractive)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yes please. I’m late for a dinner date.</p>

            <p><strong>PLUM. </strong>Where to?</p>

            <p><em>(Both exit back the way they came from.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH smiles and stands up straight. He turns to face the curtains with his hands behind his back.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH. </strong><em>(Calling off to stage L wing.) </em> Curtains, please.</p>

            <p><em>(He follows the curtain off stage. YVETTE comes to pick up the table with the CLUE board and puts it aside.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH moves behind YVETTE.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>NEWSCASTER</strong>. (Beneath the following dialogue until cut off:) “Time and time again, without apology or evasion, I—and many members of this administration—have stood for the right of the individual, for free expression of convictions, even though those convictions might be unpopular, and for uncensored use of our libraries, except as dictated by common decency.”</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Rather intimately:) Yvette?</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE yelps, startled!)</em></p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Monsieur! I didn’t hear you come in! You frightened me half to death!</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Wouldn’t want to do that. There are so many better ways to die.</p>

            <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Please turn off that noise.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE turns off the TV—cutting off the news.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Is everything ready?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good. (Calling off:) Cook?</p>

            <p><em>(In a flash of thunder/lightning, a formidable COOK, dressed perfectly, appears from the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. You called, sir?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Everything on schedule?</p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. Dinner will be ready at 7:30.</p>

            <p><strong>[MUSIC CUE #2]</strong></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. (Revealing a butcher knife on a music sting:) Sharp.</p>

            <p><em>(Just then, the doorbell rings. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Ah. Right on time. You have your instructions?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Very well then.</p>

            <p><em>(He moves to the door. YVETTE pushes off the TV. COOK exits to the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Just before opening the door:) Let the game begin.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good evening.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Yes, indeed you are expected, Colonel.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. How do you—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Interrupting:) It is Colonel Mustard, isn’t it?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. No, that’s not my name. My name is Colonel—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I believe it’s been recommended that tonight you use a pseudonym.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh, no thank you. I took an antihistamine before I came.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Taking his coat:) May I take your coat?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh. All right. I suppose I . . .</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE, at the bar cart, now pops open a bottle of champagne, a la a gunshot, startling MUSTARD who yelps.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Not to worry, Colonel. It’s just the maid, in the Hall, with the champagne cork.</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Offering:) Champagne?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Taking the glass, flummoxed by her beauty:) Oh, uh, don’t mind if I . . .</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Interrupting:) Zis way Monsieur.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Following her anywhere:) Ah. Thank you.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE escorts MUSTARD to the door of the Lounge. The doorbell interrupts. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Are you expecting someone else?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Indeed. I’ll be with you in a moment.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Do come in, madam. You are expected.</p>

            <p><em>(She enters more fully, WADSWORTH at her heels.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Welcome.</p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. (With a confident mystique:) Do you know who I am?</p>

            <p><em>(She pulls back her veil, to reveal her face.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Only that you are a socialite to be known this evening as Mrs. White.</p>

            <p><em>(She slips off her cloak, black with a brilliantly white inside.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. Yes.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I’ll be right with you.</p>

            <p><em>(The module of the set containing the door to the Lounge, now pulls open slightly, making the interior of the Lounge partially visible as WHITE steps through the door, noticing MUSTARD.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> You think I can’t handle a little blackmail?!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> (Taking the reins:) Who is this Boddy fella, you brutish butler?!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Who Ms. Boddy is, is no concern of yours. Suffice it to say, he’s a supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee—and he feels your activities have been decidedly un-American.</p>
            <p><em>(They ALL begin to protest . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> My task this evening is to expose your secrets to each other—rendering you all culpable in each others’ indiscretions.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But we hardly know each other.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Precisely.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Don’t you think that you might spare us this humiliation?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I’m afraid I have no choice. We’ll start with you, Professor Plum.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Perching on the desk:)</em> Oooh, this oughta be good.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> It says here you were once a professor of psychiatry, specializing in pathological, lying lunatics suffering from delusions of grandeur.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Yes, but now I work for the U.S. government.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> So, your work has not changed.</p>
            <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But you can’t practice medicine anymore, can you? Your license has been lifted, correct?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Why? What’d he do?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You know what male doctors aren’t supposed to do with their lady patients?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yeah?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yeah, well, he did.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> How awful! You know, someday there will be a reckoning for men like you!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> I hope so.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(A la the hashtag:)</em> Me too.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Harshly whispered:)</em> You’re disgusting.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Are you making moral judgements, Mrs. Peacock?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Well, I —</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> How then, do you justify taking bribes in return for delivering Senator Peacock’s votes to certain lobbyists?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Defensive:)</em> My husband is a paid consultant. There’s nothing sinful about that!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Not if it’s publicly declared. But if you slip cash under the stall door at Old Ebbitt’s Grill? How would you describe that transaction?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I’d say it stinks.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Accusatorially:)</em> When were you in that men’s room?</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> So, it’s true!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> No, it’s a vicious lie!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But you’ve been paying blackmail for over a year now to keep that story out of the papers. Seems a little . . . sticky, no?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Now see here—</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> <em>(Interrupting:)</em> Well, I’m willing to believe you. I too am being blackmailed for something I didn’t do.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN/MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Piping up at the same moment:)</em> So am I.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Not me.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You’re not being blackmailed?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh, I’m being blackmailed, all right. But I did what I’m being blackmailed for.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> What did you do?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I run my own business.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> That’s not a crime.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> You didn’t ask what kind of a business I run.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> All right, what kind of business do you run?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> I provide gentlemen with the company of a young lady.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Outraged:)</em> An escort service?! In Washington?!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> How scurrilous.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> I’m sure some people are just a little lonely.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(Scoffing:)</em> A man who needs to pay to spend time with a woman. That’s a problem I’ll never have.</p>
            <p><em>(He slyly takes a business card SCARLET has pulled from her cleavage and tucks it in his coat pocket.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Is that how you knew Colonel Mustard works in Washington? Is he one of your clients?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Certainly not!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I was asking Miss Scarlet.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(To SCARLET:)</em> Well, you tell him it’s not true!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> “It’s not true.”</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Is that true?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> No, it’s not true.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Ha-hah! So it is true!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> A double negative!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Double “negative”? You mean you have—photographs?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> That sounds like a confession to me. In fact, the double negative has led to proof positive. I’m afraid you gave yourself away.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Are you trying to make me look stupid in front of the other guests?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You don’t need any help from me, sir.</p>
            <p><em>(MUSTARD starts to register the insult—but . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Colonel, looks like you hold a sensitive security post in the Pentagon. Those “negatives” would most certainly compromise your position.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(With a wink:)</em> And what position exactly were you caught in, Colonel?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> This is an outrage!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Changing focus:)</em> Let’s see, who’s next?</p>
            <p><em>(He charges towards GREEN but spins on a dime at the last moment to . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Mrs. White, you’ve been paying our friend the blackmailer ever since your husband died under, shall we say, mysterious circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Say what you want. I didn’t kill him.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Then why are you paying the blackmailer?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> I don’t want another scandal, do I?</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Another?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> We had a very humiliating confrontation. He had threatened to kill me in public.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Why would he want to kill you in public?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I think she meant that he had threatened, in public, to kill her.</p>
            <p><em>(They all react with understanding.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> It was all over the papers.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> And yet he was the one who died. Not you, Mrs. White, not you.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> He was found dead at home. Unclothed. His head had been cut off and so had his . . . you know.</p>
            <p><em>(She gestures in the direction of her groin. They all react.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> But, I didn’t do it. I’d been out all evening, at the movies.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> What was showing?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> The Naked Alibi.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> A likely story.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But he was your second husband. Your first also disappeared.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> That was his job—he was an illusionist.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But he never reappeared.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> He wasn’t a very good illusionist.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Now to GREEN:)</em> And lastly, Mr. Green, who is a . . .</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I don’t need you to unmask me, Wadsworth. I know what you’re gonna say about me!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> What’s that?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> “Mr. Green, who is a homosexual.”</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Not me.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> You asked, “Who is a homosexual,” and I said, not me.</p>
            <p><em>(GREEN and WADSWORTH share a baffled moment.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yes, thank you, Colonel.</p>
            <p><em>(To GREEN:)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> But, there’s more to it than that, Mr. Green.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> How do you mean?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> There’s evidence to support the question of . . . your politics.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> My politics?! Since when is working for the Republican party a crime?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> You swore an oath of allegiance to the Republican party, but neglected to vote for Eisenhower in the last election. That’s grounds for an ousting if ever there was one.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> But voting records are confidential!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Everything has its price, Mr. Green.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> So—there you have it.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Bordering hysteria:)</em> Have what?!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> A crooked Senator’s wife, a lascivious doctor, a disloyal Republican, and so forth . . . not exactly adhering to an all-American standard of behavior, are you?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Knowingly:)</em> Depends on who you ask.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But if this Boddy fella is such a noble civilian himself, than why didn’t he report us to the authorities?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> And give up the opportunity to make a buck? Come now, Professor. What could be more American than that?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(In earnest:)</em> Apple pie.</p>
            <p><em>(A collective eye roll.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> All right, Wadsworth—so we’re being blackmailed by a renegade McCarthyist. Where does that leave us?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Where is this Ms. Boddy?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> And what does she want from us?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Who cares?! I’m not waiting to find out! I’ve done nothing wrong! I’m leaving!</p>
            <p><em>(She charges to the door.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Blocking her efforts:)</em> I’m sorry, Mrs. Peacock. You can stay in denial, but you cannot leave this house!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> I am the wife of a great Senator! You can’t tell me what to do!</p>
            <p><em>(She tries to open the door.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>BODDY.</strong> Bribing all these good people?</p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> And why would we agree to that?</p>
            <p><strong>BODDY.</strong> Because if you don’t, I’ll put this briefcase—containing all the evidence needed to expose your wrongdoings—in the hands of the police, the press, and the House Un-American Committee.

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> What do you mean?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Panic-stricken:)</em> Nobody. No body. Mr. Boddy’s body. It’s gone!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Maybe he wasn’t really dead.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> He was!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> We should have made sure.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> So was he dead or wasn’t he?!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Maybe he was dead, but someone moved him!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Who would move him?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> And why?!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> How should I know?!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Well, if he’s not here—then where is he?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Oh my. All this excitement. If you’ll excuse me, I have to uh . . . is there a little girl’s room?</p>
            <p><strong>YVETTE.</strong> Oui oui, madame.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> No, I just want to powder my nose.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Clocking PEACOCK’s exit:)</em> Uhhhh . . .</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I don’t mean to alarm anybody, but we do currently have the small issue of two dead bodies: one missing, one present—and the imminent arrival of the police . . .</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> The bridge is washed out; that should buy us some extra time.</p>
            <p><strong>YVETTE.</strong> But I don’t want extra time! I want ze polize to arrive! I am trapped in zis houze wiz a murderer!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But once the police get here, the rest of us are doomed.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Taking charge:)</em> Wadsworth, am I right in thinking that there is nobody else in this house?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Um, no.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Then there is someone else in this house?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Sorry, I said “no” meaning “yes.”</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> “No,” meaning “yes”?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yes.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Look, I want a straight answer.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Don’t look at me.</p>
            <p><em>(They look at him.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> No, there is? Or no, there isn’t?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yes.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> There seems to be some confusion about whether or not we are the only people in this house.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> There isn’t.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> There isn’t any confusion or there isn’t anybody else?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Either. Both.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Just give me a clear answer.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> What was the question?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Is there anyone else in the house?</p>
            <p><strong>ALL.</strong> No!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> That’s what he says, but does he know!?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Look, we’ve got a killer on the loose, the missing dead body of Mr. Boddy, a Cook with a Dagger in her back, and all these easily accessible weapons—the Rope, the Revolver, the Candlestick, the Wrench—and—hey, where’s the Lead Pipe?</p>
            <p><em>[MUSIC CUE #21]</em></p>
            <p><em>(PEACOCK screams. She enters, stumbling into the room with BODDY hanging all over her. It looks like BODDY is attacking her.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> It’s Mr. Boddy!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> He’s attacking her.</p>
            <p><em>(While PEACOCK continues her hysteria, the bloodied BODDY falls off of her and onto the ground. The Lead Pipe protrudes from his skull.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Grossed out:)</em> Oh God, he’s so bloody!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Stand back!</p>
            <p><em>(Completing a second cursory exam:)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> He’s dead.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> That’s what you said the last time.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I believe in second chances.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Mr. Boddy? Dead? Again?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> I’m going to faint!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I’ll catch you!</p>
            <p><em>(PEACOCK collapses in WADSWORTH’s arms. He releases her and she falls back with a thud.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Sorry.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Mrs. Peacock?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Woozy from the floor:)</em> Yes?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Where did this happen?</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> In the bathroom! I opened the door and there he was! At first, I thought he was attacking me, but then I realized he’d been left propped up against the doorframe, dead, just waiting to fall on someone!</p>
            <p><em>(She pulls a tiny bottle of booze out from her cleavage and downs it.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Who would do such a thing?</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Takes a lotta guts to kill someone twice.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> It’s what we call overkill.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> But why?!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> What’s the difference?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Makes a difference to him!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Losing it:)</em> Makes a difference to us! We’ve got to find out who killed him, where and with what!</p>
            <p><em>(Referencing the Lead Pipe in BODDY’s head.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> Seems like it was probably the Lead Pipe.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Ten points, Professor Plum.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> What kind of game are you playing, Wadsworth?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> This isn’t a game!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(To GREEN:)</em> You! The Lead Pipe belonged to you!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> But I dropped it while running to the Kitchen!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> People don’t just drop murder weapons!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I didn’t know it was a murder weapon when I dropped it!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> So anyone could have picked it up?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Becoming unhinged:)</em> Yes of course, but who did?!? Who did pick up the Lead Pipe? Who picked up the Lead Pipe and brutally murdered Mr. Boddy, leaving him dead and bloodied in the bathroom? Who did that? Who?! Who?!?! Who?!?!?!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(From the desk:)</em> Cool it, butler! While you lose your marbles, I’m over here trying to do something useful! Have you all forgotten about the evidence against us?</p>
            <p><strong>ALL.</strong> The evidence!</p>
            <p><em>(They move toward SCARLET. SCARLET tries to open Boddy’s briefcase.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Boddy’s briefcase is locked.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> There must be a key!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Mr. Green, would you be so kind as to check Mr. Boddy’s pockets for the key to his briefcase containing the evidence of our crimes, so that we may destroy said evidence once and for all?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Why me?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Why not?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Unhappily:)</em> Well . . . all right.</p>
            <p><em>(He pulls out a latex glove, putting it on.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Where’d you get that?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I don’t like germs.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Or fingerprints?</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> No, mostly it’s really just germs.</p>
            <p><em>(GREEN searches BODDY’s pocket, gagging/holding back vomit.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(With his hand in BODDY’s pocket—gagging:)</em> Oh God, it’s so warm.</p>
            <p><em>(Then)</em></p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Aha! Got it!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Give it here!</p>
            <p><em>(He rushes it over to SCARLET, who opens the briefcase.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> It’s empty!</p>
            <p><em>(They gasp!)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Empty?!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Then where’s all the evidence?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I told you Boddy was a liar! Had the evidence in his briefcase, my foot!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> We must find that evidence!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> And destroy it!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Becoming officious:)</em> Evidence against us aside, first things first. We’re in a room with two dead bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>YVETTE.</strong> And ze cops are on zeir way!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Let’s move the corpses to the couch so they look less dead.</p>
            <p><em>(They do. What follows is a farcical moving of the two dead bodies from the floor onto the sofa.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(Stepping over COOK to get to BODDY:)</em> Some party this is turning out to be.</p>
            <p><strong>YVETTE.</strong> <em>(Crossing to the COOK:)</em> Help me, Monsieur Green.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Dubious:)</em> Well, all right.</p>
            <p><em>(YVETTE/GREEN drag COOK, while PLUM drags BODDY.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Careful. Don’t get guts on the ground.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Impressed by PLUM dragging BODDY’s body:)</em> Solid battlefield technique, Professor Plum. Never leave a man behind.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Cadavers are heavier than they seem, aren’t they?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I wouldn’t know.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Right. Me neither.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Lifting BODDY up:)</em> Upsy-daisy.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> <em>(Then re: the COOK:)</em> Here, prop her up.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(From her unhelpful perch on the desk:)</em> Aren’t you all strong and virile?</p>
            <p><em>(She drinks from a flask.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(Throughout the hubbub, the GUESTS ad-lib appropriately until the bodies are both in position on the sofa with GREEN pinned between them. GREEN, gagging, un-pins himself, escaping the sofa. The GUESTS prop both bodies [Dagger and Lead Pipe fully visible] upright.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Good. They just look asleep.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Forget about the bodies! We need to do something about this room full of murder weapons and the homicidal maniac on the loose!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Let’s put the weapons in the bag!</p>
            <p><em>(WADSWORTH starts to put the remaining weapons in Boddy’s bag.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> What good will that do?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Then we’ll zip up the bag.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Most murderers know how zippers work, Mr. Wadsworth.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> I know! We’ll put the bag in the safe!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Looking all around:)</em> Terrific! Where’s the safe?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Yes! We’ll split up into pairs. That way none of us will be alone.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> But if we split up into pairs, whichever one of us is paired with the killer might get killed!</p>
            <p><strong>YVETTE.</strong> Mon dieu!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> But then we would have discovered who the murderer is!</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> But the other half of the pair would be dead!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> This is war, Peacock! Casualties are inevitable. You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs—every cook will tell you that.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> But look what happened to the Cook!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Colonel, are you willing to take that chance?</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> What choice do we have?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> None.</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> I suppose you’re right.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> <em>(Officious:)</em> All right, troops. Divide and conquer. I’ll split us into pairs. Eenie-meenie-miney . . .</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Per the rhyme:)</em> No.</p>
            <p><em>(Then taking the reins)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Mrs. White, you come with me. Professor Plum, you’re with Mrs. Peacock. Yvette, you go with Mr. Green; and Miss Scarlet, you’re with Eenie Meenie.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> But what if someone doesn’t come back?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> We’ll remember you fondly. Now, leave no door unopened. And . . . cherish your partner. This might be the last person you ever see.</p>

            <p><em>(The Hall.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(The pairs search the house through an elaborate musical montage of choreographed, door-slamming tomfoolery, punctuated by brief vignettes.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(After an initial series of highly stylized crosses and door openings, the Hall wall flies in and focus shifts to WHITE and WADSWORTH, now alone in the Hall facing two doors.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Go on. I’ll be right behind you.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> That’s why I’m nervous.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> But why? It’s just us. We’re alone.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> That’s just it, Mrs. White. No man in his right mind would ever be alone with you.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Fine. You go in there and I’ll go in here.</p>
            <p><em>(They go to two doors. They don’t go in.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Are you going in?</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Yes, are you?</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Yes.</p>
            <p><em>(They fake each other out three times in quick succession. Then . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> On the count of three. One . . . Three!</p>
            <p><em>(A beat, then WADSWORTH and WHITE enter and exit their respective rooms abruptly.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Nothing in that room.</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Nothing in that room either.</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> Shall we search the Ballroom?</p>
            <p><em>[MUSIC CUE #24]</em></p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> <em>(Gesturing for her to go first:)</em> After you.</p>
            <p><em>(WHITE and WADSWORTH’s stylized movement leads them into an elaborate tango as they exit.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(As the Hall wall flies out, The GUESTS crisscross the entry Hall causing each other to startle.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(MUSTARD and SCARLET meet in the middle, each holding a notebook and a tiny golf pencil [from the CLUE board game].)</em></p>
            <p><em>(They compare their notes and each exit separately as the Library module slides into place.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(Focus shifts to: PEACOCK and PLUM in the Library.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(Seated in an armchair:)</em> This is quite an impressive Library.</p>
            <p><em>(PEACOCK puts a book back in the bookshelf, triggering an elaborate, FBI-style secret panel labeled “EVIDENCE,” plastered with headshots [in the style of the CLUE game cards] and notes detailing the guests’ crimes, to flip and appear in the wall directly behind them. They do not see it.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> <em>(Her back now to the secret panel:)</em> How can I find anything if I don’t even know what I’m looking for!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> <em>(Reading from a book:)</em> “Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another.”</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Your fancy words don’t intimidate me, Professor!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I take no credit, Mrs. Peacock. <em>(Re: the book:)</em> Freud. I think he’s on to something.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> Now is not the time for academic pursuits! We’re supposed to find the evidence!</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> It’s a fruitless search, if you ask me. I mean, it’s not like we’re just gonna walk into a room and find the evidence plastered on the wall.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> I suppose you’re right.</p>
            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> C’mon, let’s go upstairs. Maybe we’ll be excited by something in a bedroom.</p>
            <p><strong>PEACOCK.</strong> I haven’t been excited by something in a bedroom for years.</p>
            <p><em>(They exit the Library as the module retreats.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(The GUESTS crisscross once more, featuring an unexpected, split-second connection between YVETTE and WADSWORTH.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(Then, MUSTARD, solo, crosses the Hall studying an enlarged map of Boddy Manor [looking identical to the CLUE board game].)</em></p>
            <p><em>(To the music, each GUEST round-robins through every door in choreographed mayhem. The group ends with ALL their heads poking out of one door, which WADSWORTH shuts.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(The music shifts to sinister, as the Lounge module opens and we find the MOTORIST on the phone.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>MOTORIST.</strong> I’m a little nervous. I’m at that big house on the hill, and I’ve been locked in the Lounge. I didn’t expect there’d be a whole group of people here—I think they’re having some sort of party; and the funny thing is, I think one of them is my customer.</p>
            <p><em>(As he’s talking, the portrait behind him opens and a gloved hand appears behind him with a raised Wrench . . .)</em></p>
            <p><strong>MOTORIST.</strong> Yeah, my regular Tuesday night passenger . . .</p>
            <p><em>(The Wrench comes down on the MOTORIST’S head. BLACKOUT. The Lounge retreats.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(The Conservatory.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(MUSTARD searches the Conservatory floor. SCARLET enters slyly, holding Plum’s pipe.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Whispering conspiratorially:)</em> Psst!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Oh, there you are.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> You’ll never believe what I found in the hallway. <em>(Showing:)</em> Professor Plum’s stupid tobacco pipe!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Huh. What do you think that means?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Who knows! But it seems suspicious if you ask me.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> I just did.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Honest to God, Colonel.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Moving on:)</em> This is the last room left to search in this beastly mansion, and we still haven’t found the evidence.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> I think this time has been productive nevertheless.</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Aren’t you a Pollyanna.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> You’re a brave and determined lady, Miss Scarlet. I’ve really enjoyed our time together. I hope after this expedition ends, we can remain friends.</p>
            <p><em>(SCARLET continues intensely searching.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> I mean, really, murders aside, it’s just been a lovely group of people all in all. I suppose I would like to hear Mrs. White explain when and how she lost her veil in the Billiard Room, but . . .</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Grabbing the veil:)</em> You found White’s veil in the Billiard Room? Odd.</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Odd?</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Odd.</p>
            <p><em>(MUSTARD accidentally leans on the wall sconce, which moves like a lever.)</em></p>
            <p><em>(A trap door in the floor opens.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> <em>(Gasp:)</em> A trap door!</p>
