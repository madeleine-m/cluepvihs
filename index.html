            <p><em>(The curtains are closed on a warmly lit stage. WADSWORTH walks out on stage carrying a small table and a CLUE board game. He sets it up the game on the table, taking out the YELLOW piece and setting it down)</em></p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD enters in front of the stage. She whistles with one hand in her pocket, the other holding a letter she is looking over.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK]</p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD stops in her tracks. She turns her head slightly as if to not let the dogs know she sees them.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WHITE steps in the direction of the “dog” that will be in the direction of the audience. She feels her foot step in something. Annoyed, she takes off her shoe and holds it up. She sniffs the air before aggressively sniffing the shoe. Taken aback, she gags as she is overwhelmed by the smell. Disgustedly, she puts her shoe back on and hurries off with a pained look on her face)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH holds up the BLUE piece and sets it down.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(PEACOCK enters holding her coat wrapped around her tightly.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #5]</p>

            <p><em>(GREEN enters from opposite side wondering, obviously confused, and constantly checking the letter he holds in his hand.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Where is this darn address...</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #6]</p>

            <p><em>(Startled, GREEN points in the direction he came from and then holds up his hand to thank the dog. He hurries off back the way he came from, terrified)</em></p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Nervously to the dog) </em>Thanks.</p>

            <p><em>(Finally, WADSWORTH presents both PURPLE and RED game pieces. He sets them down on the board)</em></p>

            <p><em>(Angrily, SCARLET enters in a huff)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Damn car...piece of junk.</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #7]</p>

            <p>SCARLET. Shut up!</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG WHIMPER]</p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh come on...</p>

            <p><em>(PLUM enters slyly from the same direction)</em></p>

            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I noticed a car pulled over on the roadside there. Need a lift?</p>

            <p><em>(SCARLET brushes herself off and fixes her hair, attempting to make herself look more attractive)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yes please. I’m late for a dinner date.</p>

            <p><strong>PLUM. </strong>Where to?</p>

            <p><em>(Both exit back the way they came from.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH smiles and stands up straight. He turns to face the curtains with his hands behind his back.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH. </strong><em>(Calling off to stage L wing.) </em> Curtains, please.</p>

            <p><em>(He follows the curtain off stage. YVETTE comes to pick up the table with the CLUE board and puts it aside.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH moves behind YVETTE.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>NEWSCASTER</strong>. (Beneath the following dialogue until cut off:) “Time and time again, without apology or evasion, I—and many members of this administration—have stood for the right of the individual, for free expression of convictions, even though those convictions might be unpopular, and for uncensored use of our libraries, except as dictated by common decency.”</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Rather intimately:) Yvette?</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE yelps, startled!)</em></p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Monsieur! I didn’t hear you come in! You frightened me half to death!</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Wouldn’t want to do that. There are so many better ways to die.</p>

            <p><em>(Then:)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Please turn off that noise.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE turns off the TV—cutting off the news.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Is everything ready?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good. (Calling off:) Cook?</p>

            <p><em>(In a flash of thunder/lightning, a formidable COOK, dressed perfectly, appears from the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. You called, sir?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Everything on schedule?</p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. Dinner will be ready at 7:30.</p>

            <p><strong>[MUSIC CUE #2]</strong></p>

            <p><strong>COOK</strong>. (Revealing a butcher knife on a music sting:) Sharp.</p>

            <p><em>(Just then, the doorbell rings. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Ah. Right on time. You have your instructions?</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Oui.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Very well then.</p>

            <p><em>(He moves to the door. YVETTE pushes off the TV. COOK exits to the Kitchen.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Just before opening the door:) Let the game begin.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Good evening.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Entering fully:) Good evening. I’m not sure if I’m in the right—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Yes, indeed you are expected, Colonel.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. How do you—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Interrupting:) It is Colonel Mustard, isn’t it?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. No, that’s not my name. My name is Colonel—</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I believe it’s been recommended that tonight you use a pseudonym.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh, no thank you. I took an antihistamine before I came.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. (Taking his coat:) May I take your coat?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Oh. All right. I suppose I . . .</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE, at the bar cart, now pops open a bottle of champagne, a la a gunshot, startling MUSTARD who yelps.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Not to worry, Colonel. It’s just the maid, in the Hall, with the champagne cork.</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Offering:) Champagne?</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Taking the glass, flummoxed by her beauty:) Oh, uh, don’t mind if I . . .</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. (Interrupting:) Zis way Monsieur.</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. (Following her anywhere:) Ah. Thank you.</p>

            <p><em>(YVETTE escorts MUSTARD to the door of the Lounge. The doorbell interrupts. They look out.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD</strong>. Are you expecting someone else?</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Indeed. I’ll be with you in a moment.</p>

            <p><strong>YVETTE</strong>. Follow me, Colonel.</p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Do come in, madam. You are expected.</p>

            <p><em>(She enters more fully, WADSWORTH at her heels.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Welcome.</p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. (With a confident mystique:) Do you know who I am?</p>

            <p><em>(She pulls back her veil, to reveal her face.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. Only that you are a socialite to be known this evening as Mrs. White.</p>

            <p><em>(She slips off her cloak, black with a brilliantly white inside.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. Yes.</p>

            <p><strong>WHITE</strong>. It said so in my letter. But, why—?</p>

            <p><em>(Shepherding her into the Lounge—then:)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH</strong>. I’ll be right with you.</p>

            <p><em>(The module of the set containing the door to the Lounge, now pulls open slightly, making the interior of the Lounge partially visible as WHITE steps through the door, noticing MUSTARD.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> And who are you, her henchman? You pompous, British bastard!</p>
            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> It’s Mr. Boddy? What a scoundrel!!</p>
            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> All this stress is not good for my blood pressure!</p>
            <p><strong>WHITE.</strong> You think I can’t handle a little blackmail?!</p>
            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> (Taking the reins:) Who is this Boddy fella, you brutish butler?!</p>
            <p><strong>WADSWORTH.</strong> Who Mr. Boddy is, is no concern of yours. Suffice it to say, he’s a supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee—and he feels your activities have been decidedly un-American.</p>
